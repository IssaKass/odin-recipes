    <!-- Description Section -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These super soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies are the most popular cookie recipe on my website for good
      reason.
      Melted butter, more brown sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the absolute
      chewiest
      chocolate chip cookie texture. The cookie dough is slick and requires chilling prior to shaping the cookies.

    <!-- Ingredients Section -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 and 1/4 cups (280g) <strong>all-purpose flour</strong> (spooned & leveled)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <strong>baking soda</strong></li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons <strong>cornstarch</strong></li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
      <li>3/4 cup (170g / 12 Tbsp) <strong>unsalted butter</strong>, melted & cooled 5 minutes</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark <strong>brown sugar</strong></li>
      <li>1/2 cup (100g) <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
      <li>1 large <strong>egg</strong> + 1 <strong>egg yolk</strong>, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons <strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></li>
      <li>1 and 1/4 cups (225g) <strong>semi-sweet chocolate chips</strong> or <strong>chocolate chunks</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps Section -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar
        lumps remain.
        Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry
        ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and
        appear
        greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted
        butter, but do
        your best to combine them.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly
        recommend
        chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.
      </li>
      <li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to <strong>325°F (163°C)</strong>. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking
        mats. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of
        dough for XL
        cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a
        ball, making
        sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat
        with
        remaining dough. Place 8-9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet.
      </li>
      <li>Bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to
        14
        minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking
        sheet
        for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional
        and
        only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool
        completely.
      </li>
      <li>Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
