    <!-- Steps Section -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>To make the dough:</strong> Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then
        sweeping
        off any excess. In a medium bowl, mix the dry ingredients, then add the water. Stir until just combined, making
        a
        rough but cohesive dough.</li>
      <li>Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise at room temperature overnight, for at least 12 hours and up to 24
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then
        cut
        into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.</li>
      <li>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while
        you
        prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy
        baking
        sheet (turned upside down), or cast iron skillet in the oven.</li>
      <li>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles
        form
        and do not deflate.</li>
      <li>Stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will
        slightly
        shrink and puff up during baking.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside-down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and
        ingredients of your choice.</li>
      <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are
        golden
        brown.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
